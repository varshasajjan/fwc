# Write a function ,that can take two integers, swap their values and print their new values in function itself. function return type should be void.

We initialize a void main function to return void and write a progrsm to swap two numbers either by addition subtraction method, or a count variable method
Here we take an extra variable temp and use it as temporary memory storage of a number while swapping, then the function is called in int main and returns the swapped value
