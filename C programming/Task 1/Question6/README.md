# Write two source files, main.c and swap.c. The main function initializes a two-element array of ints, and then calls the swap function to swap the pair.
Open your termux and in the terminal, make two files nano main.c and nano swap.c and compile these two files together:
```bash
gcc main.c swap.c -o program
./program
```
